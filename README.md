# COVID19 Info portal

## Description

This is a basic website to give some info about new corona virus disease. It's currently using the API built by mathdroid [https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api).

Frontend stack is next.js and tailwindcss.

Feel free to contribute and make PRs if you can improve or add some features. I keep the full discretion to refuse any PR I don't think suits the site. Translations to any other languages are more then welcome.

## If you want to add a translation

There is a `locales` folder, create a new folder inside of with your language code. Then just copy from `en.json` and translate and create a PR.

There is also `utils/countriesTranslations.ts` file, which contains all the country names, which you can translate to your language code (if you do not, they will appear in English.).
